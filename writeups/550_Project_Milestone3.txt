1. Find the proportion of pitches that a particular pitcher ('First Last') throws in each zone. 

WITH tmp(Zone, pitch_count)
    AS (SELECT Zone, COUNT(pitch_id)
        FROM Pitches
        WHERE player_ID = (SELECT PlayerID
                           FROM Players
                           WHERE Name = 'First Last')
        GROUP BY zone)
SELECT Zone, pitch_count / SUM(pitch_count) as zone_proportion
FROM tmp
ORDER BY pitch_count / SUM(pitch_count)



2. Find all of the pitch types that a particular pitcher ('First Last') throws and their proportions
   in the 2022 season. 

WITH tmp(Type, pitch_count)
    AS (SELECT Type, COUNT(pitch_id)
        FROM Pitches
        WHERE player_ID = (SELECT PlayerID
                           FROM Players
                           WHERE Name = 'First Last')
              AND Season = '2022'
        GROUP BY Type)
SELECT Type, pitch_count / SUM(pitch_count) as pitch_type_proportion
FROM tmp
ORDER BY pitch_count / SUM(pitch_count)



3. Compare a particular team's pitchers based on their earned run average (ERA).

SELECT p.Name, p2.EarnedRunAverage
FROM Players p JOIN Pitchers p2 ON p.PlayerID = p2.playerID
WHERE pi.Team = 'PHI'
ORDER BY p2.EarnedRunAverage DESC
